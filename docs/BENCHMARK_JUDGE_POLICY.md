# Benchmark Judge Policy

AutoMem internal benchmark runs use a pinned OpenAI judge snapshot:

- Model: `gpt-5.4-mini-2026-03-17`
- Profile: `openai-gpt-5.4-mini-2026-03-17`
- Provider: `openai`

Use this judge for routine BEAM, LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and regression tracking
so scores remain comparable over time. Result JSON and manifests should record
`judge_model`, `judge_profile`, `judge_provider`, and `judge_snapshot_pinned`.

External published comparisons are separate runs. Match the published judge
configuration exactly and label the run with an explicit non-canonical profile,
for example:

```bash
python3 runners/run_beam.py --judge-model gpt-5 --judge-profile published-mem0-gpt-5
```

Do not compare scores unless judge metadata matches or the difference is called
out directly.
